**ADD FIVE ASSET MANAGEMENT**

Operational discipline. Measured improvement. Structured control.

Add Five Asset Management is a personal lab focused on practical automation, governance modeling, and lifecycle optimization within enterprise IT environments.


This repository contains lightweight tools, scripts, and experimentation projects centered around:

IT Asset Management (ITAM)

Hardware Asset Management (HAM)

Lifecycle state control

Automation for operational efficiency

Governance reinforcement through scripting
